        <li>Added Endpoint.</li>
    </ul>
</div></blockquote>

#### Input Parameters
* `player` - _required_ - The Player's Gamertag<br/>

### Halo 5 - Player Emblem Image
<blockquote><p>This Endpoint returns an HTTP Redirect (302 Found) response to the caller with the URL of an image of the Player's Emblem. The initial request to this API that returns the HTTP Redirect is throttled and requires a Subscription Key. However, the image itself (at hostname "image.halocdn.com") is not throttled and does not require a Subscription Key. Note that if the Player later changes their Emblem, the image itself is not refreshed and will need to be refreshed via a new request to this API.</p>

### Halo 5 - Player Spartan Image
